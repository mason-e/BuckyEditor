## Critical


## High Priority

- Show address of individual tiles somehow. Maybe on mouseover?
- Show addresses within editors
- Can change palette and pattern table on main screen but not block editor
    - Option A: Duplicate main editor flow (buttons, etc.)
    - Option B: Find way to pass through from main form
    - Option C: Leave it because it shouldn't affect metatile composition
- Pre load config files into dropdown options (first level, then section) rather than a loading pop-up
- Investigate the palette assigning functions - seems like it was meant to work, but doesn't

## Nice to Have

- Keyboard navigation
- Display issues with the currently loaded level in editor instead of file comments
- Change all references to "Blocks" to "Metatiles"
- Remove references to "Big Blocks"
- Remove anything to do with layers
