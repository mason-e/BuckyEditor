## Critical

- Restore ability to change palette on screens that use multiple
- Restore ability to change pattern table on screens that use multiple

## High Priority

- Change screen, pattern table and palette for currently loaded section to arrows instead of dropdowns (removes "Advanced" menu)
- Pre load config files into dropdown options (first level, then section) rather than a loading pop-up
- Investigate the palette assigning functions - seems like it was meant to work, but doesn't

## Nice to Have

- Display issues with the currently loaded level in editor instead of file comments
- Simplify getScreensOffset function (dimensions go into it twice)
- Make showing block address a toggle checkmark instead of
- Change all references to "Blocks" to "Metatiles"
- Remove references to "Big Blocks"
